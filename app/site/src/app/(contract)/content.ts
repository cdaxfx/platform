        <p>
          If it is necessary for you to provide personal information about other
          individuals in the course of dealing with us, for example regarding
          directors and shareholders of a company, or the other party to a joint
          account, you should do so only where you are authorised by those
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>Recipients</p>
        <p>
          When you engage an individual who is not a CDAX customer in a
          transaction, e.g. by sending a payment to that individual, we will
          retain the information that you submit to us, including, for example,

          Although the information on Connected Parties and/or Recipients is
          stored for a certain period of time in compliance with applicable law,
          we will not use it to market to the non-registered person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, these persons have the same rights to access and correct
          information about themselves as registered users of CDAX. You should
          bring this Privacy Policy to their attention at the earliest
          opportunity so they aware of how their information will be processed

        </p>

        <p>Information about you that we receive from third parties</p>
        <p>Fraud prevention checks</p>
        <p>
          To protect ourselves and our customers against fraud, we verify the
          information you provide with Anti-Fraud Agencies and Electronic
          Identity Verification Services. In the course of verification, we
          receive information about you from such services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you register a debit card or bank account with CDAX, we will use
          card authorisation and anti-fraud screening services to verify that
          your bank or card information and address match the information you
          supplied to CDAX, and that the card has not been reported as lost or
          stolen.
        </p>
        <p>Identity verification using Electronic Verification Providers</p>
        <p>
          Any electronic identity check with a credit agency may leave a record
          on your credit file. By agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy,
          you agree that we may carry out such searches in the knowledge that it
          may leave a record on your credit history. If you are a joint account
          holder, in certain circumstances credit agencies may link your record
          with your spouse, partner or other financial associates.
        </p>
        <p>Background checks</p>
        <p>
          We conduct a background check on all our customers (and for business
          customers, also on the business’s directors, shareholders and
          partners). During this process we will obtain information about you
          and/or your business, its directors, shareholders and partners, from
          an identity verification provider.
        </p>
        <p>Social media</p>
        <p>
          If you allow us to, we will collect friend lists from Facebook and
          similar information from other third parties such as Twitter and
          Google – the app will periodically re-collect this information in
          order to stay up-to-date – and we may collect other information you
          have chosen to make publicly available on social media sites. Where we
          are one of your connections on a social media site, we may also
          connect information you have chosen to share with your connections on
          that site.
        </p>
        <p>Information about you from other sources</p>
        <p>
          We may also collect information about you from other sources,
          including other companies (subject to their privacy policies and
          applicable law), and from other accounts we have reason to believe you
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may receive information about you if you use any of the other
          websites we, or our group companies, operate or the other services we
          provide. We are also working closely with third parties (including,
          for example, business partners and affiliates, customers who
          participate in our refer-a-friend programme, service providers,
          advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information
          providers) and may receive information about you from them. This may
          be combined with the information you provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will use information we receive from business partners for
          marketing purposes only if you have provided your consent to do so,
          either to the third party which collected the information, or to us.
        </p>

        <p>Sensitive data</p>
        <p>
          Data privacy regulations prohibit the processing of ‘special
          categories of personal data’, also called ‘sensitive data’ unless you
          have given your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sensitive data includes information revealing racial or ethnic origin,
          political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union
          membership, genetic data, biometric data, and data concerning health,
          sex life or sexual orientation. There are also restrictions on
          processing of criminal convictions and offences.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid infringing these restrictions, it is CDAX’s policy that we do
          not ask for or collect any of the above data from you or any other
          party, so we therefore ask that you please do not reveal any sensitive
          data about yourself or others in any communication with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do reveal sensitive data, for example by phone or in an email,
          you will be giving express consent for us to process that information
          by storing the recording of the telephone call, or the email or other
          communication.
        </p>

        <h3>3. How we use your information</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>4. Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our
          website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you
          browse our website and also allows us to improve our site and to
          provide interest-based advertising. You may adjust the settings on
          your browser to refuse cookies but some of the services on our
          website(s) may not work if you do so. For detailed information on the

        </p>
        <h3>5. Sharing information with third parties</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>To support our business and provide services to you</li>
          <li>
            Just like most banks and financial/payment service providers, CDAX
            works with third-party service providers (including banking partners
            and banking intermediaries) who provide important functions that
            allow us to make our money transfer services easier, faster, and
            safer.
          </li>
          <li>
            This includes business partners under contract with us who support
            our business operations, such as fraud prevention, bill collection,
            marketing, customer service, contract administration and technology
            services. We need to disclose user data to them from time to time so
            that the services can be performed. Our contracts dictate that these
            business partners only use your information in connection with the
            services they perform for us and not for their own benefit.
          </li>
          <li>
            By accepting this Privacy Policy and maintaining an account with
            CDAX, you expressly consent to the transfer of your data to those
            third parties for the purposes listed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Banks and payment providers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you ask us to process a currency or payment transaction, we
            will provide your information to the business partners who are
            contracted to CDAX to complete this transaction, for example passing
            bank details to correspondent bank(s) or payment provider(s)
            involved in the transaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
          Anti-fraud, anti-money laundering, sanctions and risk management
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To carry out the checks described in section 3, we will provide your
            information to our third party business partners who carry out these
            checks, including photographs of yourself or your identity documents
            that you have provided to us.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Reporting to regulators</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As a regulated financial institution, in some jurisdictions we are
            obliged to report transactions to the relevant financial regulator.
            Where required, we will provide your information to the regulators
            to meet these legal obligations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Credit card associations and legal process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We may also disclose necessary information in response to the
            requirements of credit card associations or a civil or criminal
            legal process.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may disclose or share your information in order to enforce or
            apply the Terms and Conditions – and other agreements – between you
            and us, or to investigate potential breaches to protect the rights,
            property, or safety of CDAX, our customers, or others. This includes
            exchanging information with other companies and organisations for
            the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction and, if
            required, to obtain professional advice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Where required by law</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We may disclose necessary information to the police and other law
            enforcement agencies, security forces, competent governmental,
            intergovernmental or supranational bodies, competent agencies,
            departments, regulatory authorities, self-regulatory authorities or
            organisations, and other third parties, including CDAX Group
            companies, where we are legally compelled and/or permitted to do so.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mergers and acquisitions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            As with any business, it is possible that in the future CDAX could
            buy, merge with, or be acquired by, another company. We may disclose
            your information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business
            or assets, along with its professional advisers. If CDAX or a
            substantial proportion of its assets are acquired by a third party,
            information held by us about our customers will be one of the
            transferred assets, and such successor company would continue to be
            bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Analytics and search engine providers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We share your IP address with analytics and search engine providers
            that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site, and
            also for 3rd party advertising on 3rd party websites. See also our
            Cookie Policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Affiliates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you are referred to us by a third party – either via our
            affiliate network or via the refer-a-friend promotion – depending on
            the arrangement, we may notify them when you book a transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have a select group of affiliates to whom we occasionally refer
            customers. If we think you may benefit from these services, we will
            ask you if you would like us to pass on your details. We will always
            name the affiliate and ask you for permission before we refer you,
            and we will pass on your details only where you give us permission
            to do so. If we refer you, we will typically pass on your name,
            email address and telephone number.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Third party websites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Our site may, from time to time, contain links to the websites of
            our business partners, advertisers and affiliates.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you request a quote directly on a third-party website or via a
            third party application, any information that you enter on that
            website or application (and not directly through CDAX’s website) may
            be shared with the owner of any such third party website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and
            we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those policies.
            Please check those policies before you submit any information to
            third party websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>6. Transferring data overseas</h3>

        <p>
          CDAX is committed to adequately protecting your information regardless
          of where the data resides and to providing appropriate protection for
          your information where such data is transferred outside of the EEA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
          stored in, a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may
          also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us
          or for our suppliers. These staff may be engaged in the fulfilment of
          your request, the processing of your payment details and the provision
          of support services. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to
          ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The laws in some countries may not provide as much legal protection
          for your information as in the EEA. In these circumstances, our policy
          to protect your data is to rely on findings of adequacy by the
          European Commission (for countries in scope of those findings), the
          EU-US Privacy Shield (for transfers to the USA) or standard
          contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission or the IOM
          Information Commissioner (for all other countries).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time you attempt to make a money transfer using your CDAX
          account, CDAX may transfer your relevant information to the recipient
          and any intermediate banks or payment service providers, who may be
          located outside the EEA, and any other service providers as described
          above, in order to process, execute or otherwise deal with and provide
          information about the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          By submitting your information and making use of CDAX services, you
          agree to such transfers, storing or processing. We will take all steps
          reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated
          securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will do our best to protect your information, however we cannot
          guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site or
          sent to us by email or other non-secure electronic methods; any such
          transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your
          information, we will use protective procedures and security features
          to try to prevent unauthorised access.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Data Retention Policy</h3>
        <p>
          We are obliged by our regulators to retain account data for 6 years
          after the closure of an account. In some circumstances, such as an
          enquiry from a law enforcement agency, we may have to hold it longer.
          We may also retain information if required to protect our interests,
          for example in case of litigation. When data falls outside those
          retention periods we will take steps to delete it from our system.
          Where you have asked us not to contact you, we will retain that
          information on a ‘do not contact’ list to reduce the risk of us
          contacting you in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Systems Security Policy</h3>

        <p>
          CDAX has security measures in place designed to prevent data loss, to
          preserve data integrity, and to control access to the data. Only
          authorised employees of CDAX and our business partners processing data
          on our behalf have access to your personal data. All CDAX employees
          who have access to your personal data are required to comply with our
          privacy policy. All business partners are requested by CDAX to ensure
          that any of their employees who have access to your personal data have
          signed non-disclosure agreements. Contracts with business partners
          acting as data processors for CDAX involving personal data require an
          adequate level of security and require that personal data is processed
          only as instructed by CDAX.
        </p>
        <p>System security and monitoring</p>
        <p>
          To ensure data privacy, confidentiality and integrity, all information
          disclosed, shared, stored or used and any transactions performed by
          you through our website and app are encrypted.
        </p>
        <p>
          To provide a secure environment for our website and app, we hold your
          data in secure data centres with high levels of physical and technical
          security, including using firewall systems, data encryption and
          anti-virus protection. We use security surveillance systems to detect
          and prevent illegitimate access to and activities on our systems.
          External security experts conduct regular security reviews on our
          systems and we work with them to keep abreast of information security
          technology developments and implement relevant enhancement.
        </p>
        <p>Password security</p>
        <p>
          To control access to our services, every customer is required to input
          a Username and Password. To help us protect your information, you are
          advised to do the following:

            person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using personal information such as your name, birth date or
            telephone number, or ordinary words found in a dictionary.
          </li>
          <li>Memorise your password – do not write it down.</li>
          <li>
            Never reveal the password to anyone else. We will never ask you for
            your password and you should not disclose it to anyone claiming to
            work for us or our business partners.
          </li>
          <li>Do not use the same password on other services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Customer responsibilities</p>
        <p>

          It is your responsibility to safeguard your online information and
          transactions by taking all reasonable measures which may include the

          into an FX Contract or an Onward Payment, such money will be held by
          CDAX Forex in a Segregated Bank Account in exchange for the issuance
          of Electronic Money into the Client’s appropriate Electronic Money
          Account.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2 CDAX Forex will redeem Electronic Money held by the Client and use
          the corresponding funds to pay for any amount the Client owes to CDAX
          Forex including:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) any sums owing to CDAX Forex under any FX Contract including,
          without limitation, the amount required to be paid in any Deal
          Confirmation, any Security Payment and/or Margin Call;
        </p>
        <p>(b) any sums required by CDAX Forex to make any Onward Payment;</p>
        <p>
          (c) any other fees, costs, taxation liabilities, margin calls, or
          charges incurred by CDAX Forex in relation to the Client or for the
          payment of interest in accordance with Clause 24.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.3 Following fulfilment of all outstanding FX Contracts between CDAX
          Forex and the Client under these Terms, any excess amount held by CDAX
          Forex for the Client in respect of the Client’s FX Contracts shall be,
          after first being applied by payment to CDAX Forex in satisfaction of
          all claims of CDAX Forex against the Client arising under these Terms
          or under any FX Contract, sent to a Segregated Bank Account in
          exchange for the issuance of Electronic Money into an Electronic Money
          Account belonging to the Client.
        </p>
        <h3>9. TERMS OF CDAX FOREX HOLDING ELECTRONIC MONEY</h3>
        <p>
          9.1 When CDAX Forex holds Electronic Money on the Client’s behalf,
          CDAX Forex holding the funds corresponding to the Electronic Money is
          not the same as a Bank holding money in that: (a) CDAX Forex cannot
          and will not use the funds to invest or lend to other persons or
          entities; (b) the Electronic Money will not accrue interest; and (c)
          the Electronic Money does not constitute a deposit and is not covered
          by any Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2 CDAX Forex may hold the Client’s Electronic Money indefinitely.
          However, if CDAX Forex holds Electronic Money for a Client for more
          than two years, CDAX Forex shall use reasonable endeavours to contact
          the Client to redeem the Electronic Money and return the corresponding
          funds to the
        </p>
        <p>
          Client. If CDAX Forex is unable to contact the Client, it may redeem
          the Electronic Money and send the corresponding funds, less any of its
          costs incurred, to the last known bank account CDAX Forex has on file
          for the Client.
        </p>
        <h4>TERMS APPLYING TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE SERVICES</h4>
        <h3>10. INITIATING A FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION</h3>
        <p>
          10.1 The Client or its Authorised Person may from time to time provide
          an FX Order to CDAX Forex in accordance with Clause 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.2 Following receipt of an FX Order, CDAX Forex shall, if it is
          willing to accept the FX Order, agree with the Client the terms on
          which it is willing to enter into the FX Contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.3 If CDAX Forex accepts the FX Order, CDAX Forex shall subsequently
          provide a Deal Confirmation to the Client confirming the details of
          the FX Order (the ‘Deal Confirmation’) either by fax or email, or
          (where the Client has not advised CDAX Forex of its fax or email
          contact details) by post. The Deal Confirmation shall include details
          of:
        </p>
        <p>(a) the FX Order and the exchange rate applying;</p>
        <p>
          (b) the date for delivery of or payment for the currency (the
          ‘Maturity Date’);
        </p>
        <p>(c) CDAX Forex’s charges in relation to the FX Contract;</p>
        <p>(d) CDAX Forex’s charges in relation to the Payment Service;</p>
        <p>
          (e) in the case of an FX Contract which is not a spot contract,
          instalment payments to be made by the Client as determined in CDAX
          Forex’s absolute discretion; and
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) in the case of an FX Contract where payment for currency is to be
          made in a currency other than sterling, the currency in which payments
          by the Client are to be made.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.4 Upon receipt by the Client of the Deal Confirmation, the Client
          should check the Deal Confirmation for any omissions and/or errors. In
          the event of any omission and/or error, the Client must provide
          immediate notice in writing to CDAX Forex in accordance with Clause 3
          setting out full details of the omission and/or error. Subject to
          Clause 10.5, notwithstanding any omission and/or error in the Deal
          Confirmation, the FX Contract relating to the FX Order detailed in the
          Deal Confirmation will be binding on the Client and CDAX Forex, and
          CDAX Forex’s and the Client’s rights under these Terms in respect of
          the FX Contract shall apply with full effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.5 CDAX Forex will not be bound by any FX Contract where it is
          reasonably determined by CDAX Forex that there is a Manifest Error in
          the purchase or sale price quoted in the Deal Confirmation. In these
          Terms, a “Manifest Error” refers to a manifest or obvious misquote of
          the purchase or sale price quoted to the Client, including a misquote
          based on a published price source on which CDAX Forex has relied in
          connection with the FX Contract, having regard to the market
          conditions at the time the FX Order was received.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.6 Once CDAX Forex has transmitted a Deal Confirmation confirming an
          FX Order in writing, the Client may only amend or cancel the Deal
          Confirmation if CDAX Forex expressly agrees (and any such amendment or
          cancellation shall be on the conditions specified by CDAX Forex) or
          otherwise in accordance with the provisions of Clause 10.9.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.7 CDAX Forex may at its absolute discretion refuse any FX Order or
          instructions given by the Client without giving any reason or being
          liable for any loss the Client suffers as a result of such refusal.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.8 CDAX Forex may (but shall not be obliged to) require further
          confirmation or information from the Client or an Authorised Person of
          any FX Order or instruction if:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) CDAX Forex considers that such confirmation or information is
          desirable or that an FX Order or instruction is ambiguous;
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) CDAX Forex has not satisfied itself that the person giving the FX
          Order is the Client or an Authorised Person; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) the instruction is to close the Client‘s account or to remit the
          Client’s funds to a third party.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.9 The Client may terminate an FX Contract entered into under these
          Terms prior to the Maturity Date of such FX Contract by giving notice
          in writing to CDAX Forex in accordance with Clause 3 subject to the
          following conditions:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) Each party will remain liable to perform accrued but unperformed
          obligations which have fallen due before termination, but all other
          rights will cease upon such termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The Client will be liable for all of the costs, expenses and
          losses (and interest at the rate referred to in Clause 25 on any such
          sums) that CDAX Forex may incur (including any action it may take or
          have taken to cover or reduce its exposure) as a result of CDAX Forex
          entering into such FX Contract with the Client (including the actual
          or hypothetical costs of unwinding any hedging arrangements which are
          referable to such FX Contract). Any excess amount held by CDAX Forex
          in respect of an FX Contract shall be returned to the Client after
          deducting all other sums due to CDAX Forex.
        </p>
        <p>10.10 Limit Order Contracts</p>
        <p>
          (a) CDAX Forex may agree to enter into a contract with the Client (a
          “Limit Order Contract”) in consideration for the promise by the Client
          to abide by its obligation under the corresponding FX Contract if
          entered into, whereby an FX Order is deemed to have been sent from the
          Client to CDAX Forex without further notice being provided to the
          Client, upon CDAX Forex being able to provide the Client with an
          exchange rate which is the same as the exchange rate which the Client
          requested upon entering into the Limit Order Contract (the “Limit
          Order Threshold Exchange Rate”). Limit Order Contracts can either be
          entered into for a specified period of time (referred to as the
          “Validity Period”) or indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) The Limit Order Contract may be entered into either by email,
          telephone (using the details set out in Clause 3(b)) or by using the
          Online System, between the hours of 9am and 5pm on a ‘Business Day’
          (being a day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which banks are open
          for business in London and any other geographic locations required to
          complete the transaction).
        </p>
        <p>
          Should the Client place an order to enter into a Limit Order Contract
          outside these hours, the order will only be considered on the next
          Business Day. CDAX Forex will send a confirmation of the details of
          the Limit Order Contract immediately after the Limit Order Contract
          has been agreed. If the Client notices any error or discrepancy, it
          must inform CDAX Forex as soon as reasonably possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) Upon entering into a Limit Order Contract, the Client and CDAX
          Forex shall agree:
        </p>
        <p>(i) the Limit Order Threshold Exchange Rate;</p>
        <p>
          (ii) the currencies which the Client wishes to purchase and sell under
          associated FX Contract;
        </p>
        <p>
          (iii) the amount of the currencies which the Client wishes to purchase
          and sell under the associated FX Contract;
        </p>
        <p>(iv) the Validity Period, if any.</p>
        <p>
          (d) Should CDAX Forex be able to offer the Limit Order Threshold
          Exchange Rate whilst the Limit Order Contract is live, then:
        </p>
        <p>
          (i) the Client will be deemed to have sent the FX Order to CDAX Forex,
          at the time CDAX Forex is able to offer the Client the Limit Order
          Threshold Exchange Rate; and
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii) the terms of the associated FX Order and FX Contract shall be
          those agreed in the Limit Order Contract and CDAX Forex and the Client
          shall be bound by the terms of such associated FX Contract.
        </p>
        <p>(e) If the Limit Order Contract has been entered into:</p>
        <p>
          (i) for a Validity Period and CDAX Forex is unable to offer the Client
          the Limit Order Threshold Exchange Rate during the Validity Period,
          then no FX Order will be deemed to have been sent from the Client to
          CDAX Forex and the Limit Order Contract will expire and be null and
          void at 4pm (London time) on the last Business Day of the Validity
          Period;
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii) for a Validity Period, then the Client may terminate the Limit
          Order Contract prior to the expiry of the Validity Period in
          accordance with Clause 10.10(f); and
        </p>
        <p>
          (iii) for an indefinite period, then the Limit Order Contract will
          only become null and void upon termination in accordance with Clause
          10.10(f).
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) The Client may terminate a Limit Order Contract either by phone
          during business hours or by sending a notice in writing to CDAX Forex.
          If the written notice is sent to CDAX Forex on a day which is not a
          Business Day or outside the hours of 9 am and 5 pm on a Business Day,
          then the notice of termination will not be deemed to have been
          received by CDAX Forex until the following Business Day.
        </p>
        <p>
          (g) For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of a Limit Order
          Contract will not be effective if the associated FX Order has already
          been deemed to have been sent to CDAX Forex and the FX Contract
          entered into. If the Client wishes to cancel the FX Contract, the
          terms of Clause 10.9 shall apply.
        </p>
        <h3>11. UPLOADS RELATING TO FX CONTRACTS AND DEDUCTIONS</h3>
        <p>
          11.1 Where CDAX Forex and the Client enter into an FX Contract, the
          Client must make sure that it holds enough Electronic Money, in the
          currency specified in the Deal Confirmation, on or before the Maturity
          Date.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.2 If an FX Contract is not a spot contract then the Client will
          need to hold enough Electronic Money, in the currency specified in the
          Deal Confirmation, on or before the times specified in the Deal
          Confirmation and/or subsequently notified to the Client from time to
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.3 Failure by the Client to hold the correct amount and currency of
          Electronic Money on the date(s) (a) specified in the Deal
          Confirmation; and/or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) (if applicable) as notified to the Client from time to time, shall
          relieve CDAX Forex of any obligation to redeem the Electronic Money to
          make a corresponding payment under the relevant FX Contract.
        </p>
        <h3>
          12. REDEMPTION OF ELECTRONIC MONEY TO FULFIL FX CONTRACTS AND
          DEDUCTIONS
        </h3>
        <p>
          12.1 After CDAX Forex and the Client have entered into an FX Contract
          and subject to Clause 12.2, CDAX Forex shall redeem the Electronic
          Money and use the corresponding funds for payment of monies owing to
          CDAX Forex under the FX Contract including, without limitation, any
          Security Payment or Margin Call (as defined below).
        </p>
        <p>
          12.2 The Client accepts that, prior to undertaking an FX Contract,
          CDAX Forex will deduct from the corresponding funds set out in Clause
          12.1 those costs and charges which CDAX Forex is entitled to
        </p>
        <p>
          pursuant to these Terms including any advance or instalment payments,
          transfer charges, deal profit and interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          12.3 The Client is solely responsible for ensuring that, following the
          deductions referred to in Clause 12.2 and the application of the
          exchange rate agreed in the Deal Confirmation, the amount of any
          Onward Payment will be sufficient to fulfil any obligations that
          Client has to the relevant Payee.
        </p>
        <h3>13. FOREIGN EXCHANGE CHARGES</h3>
        <p>
          CDAX Forex’s charges in relation to Foreign Exchange Services will be
          as set out in the Deal Confirmation. The Client understands that
          because CDAX Forex deals as principal the exchange rate it offers the
          Client will not be the same as the rate CDAX Forex obtains itself.
        </p>
        <h3>14. ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR FORWARD FX CONTRACTS</h3>
        <p>
          14.1 This Clause 14 applies in respect of any forward FX Contract,
          meaning an FX Contract under which currency is bought and sold for
          delivery at a future time.
        </p>
        <p>
          14.2 Subject to any facility, CDAX Forex will require an agreed
          security payment (“Security Payment”) from the Client for each order
          for a forward FX Contract and CDAX Forex will be entitled to request
          from the Client immediate additional security payments in amounts
          notified by CDAX Forex to the Client in the event of exchange rate
          fluctuations at any time prior to the Maturity Date (‘Margin Call’).
          The Client agrees that it is the Client’s responsibility to ensure
          that it is contactable and has provided sufficient contact details so
          that CDAX Forex can contact the Client in the event of a Margin Call.
          If CDAX Forex is unable to contact the Client by the end of the day in
          which a Margin Call occurs CDAX Forex will be entitled to terminate
          the FX Contract in accordance with Clause 17. CDAX Forex may redeem
          Electronic Money held by the Client to pay for any Margin Call.
        </p>
        <p>
          14.3 With CDAX Forex’s agreement the Client may draw down against an
          open forward FX Contract at any time up until its Maturity Date.
        </p>
        <h3>15. USE OF MONEY PURCHASED IN AN FX CONTRACT</h3>
        <p>
          15.1 The Client may use the money purchased in an FX Contract
          (Purchase Monies) to enter into an Onward Payment. If the Client
          wishes to so do, then it must notify CDAX Forex not less than 2
          Business Days before the Maturity Date of the FX Contract of the
          details of the beneficiaries of Onward Payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          15.2 As an alternative to Clause 15.1 or if details of the beneficiary
          are not provided on time, then the Purchase Monies will be sent to the
          Segregated Bank Account in exchange for the issuance to the Client of
          Electronic Money into the Client’s appropriate Electronic Money
          Account, provided CDAX Forex is able to provide an Electronic Money
          Account in the same currency as the Purchase Monies.
        </p>
        <p>
          15.3 If details of the beneficiary are not provided on time and CDAX
          Forex is unable to provide an Electronic Money Account in the same
          currency as the Purchase Monies, then CDAX Forex reserves the right to
          use the Purchase Monies to purchase money in a currency which CDAX
          Forex can provide an Electronic Money Account and send the exchanged
          money to one of CDAX Forex’s Segregated Bank Accounts in exchange for
          the issuance of Electronic Money into the Client’s appropriate
          Electronic Money Account.

        <h3>17. DEFAULT, CLOSE OUT & REFUSAL TO PERFORM FX CONTRACTS</h3>
        <p>
          17.1 CDAX Forex may refuse to perform or may close out all or any part
          of any FX Contract, without incurring any liability to the Client for
          losses that may be sustained as a result and without giving notice to
        </p>
        <p>
          the Client or receiving any instructions from it, upon or at any time
          after the happening of any of the following events:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) The Client fails to hold the correct amount of Electronic Money in
          the correct currency at the stipulated time or otherwise is unable to
          make any payment when due under these Terms or any FX Contract.

        <p>
          (b) CDAX Forex has been unable to contact the Client by the end of the
          day in which a Margin Call occurs.

        <p>(c) For a Client who is an individual, the Client:</p>
        <p>
          (i) dies or, in CDAX Forex’s reasonable suspicion, becomes of unsound
          mind; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii) suspends payment of its debts, makes or takes steps with a view
          to making any moratorium, assignment, composition or similar
          arrangement with creditors, has a receiver appointed in respect of
          some or all assets, takes or has any proceedings taken against them in
          bankruptcy, or has anything similar to any of the events described in
          this Clause 17.1(c) happen to the Client anywhere in the world.

          (a) for any delay or failure to perform its obligations under these
          Terms relating to Foreign Exchange Services or any FX Contract by
          reason of any cause beyond the reasonable control of CDAX Forex, but
          CDAX Forex shall try to perform those obligations as soon as it
          reasonably can in any event;

          Exchange Services or the enforcement of its rights under these Terms

          or an Authorised Person; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) CDAX Forex or the Client exercising its rights under these Terms
          to close out all or any part of any FX Contract before its applicable

          Payment Instruction must confirm the details of the proposed Payee
          including its full name, account details for payment and any unique
          identifier confirmed to the
        </p>
        <p>
          Client by the Payee. The provision of a Payment Instruction by the
          Client to CDAX Forex in accordance with Clause 3 is deemed, under
          these Terms, to be the Client’s consent for CDAX Forex to execute the
          corresponding Onward Payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.2 The Payment Instruction shall be deemed to be received at the
          time at which it is received except that:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) where the Payment Instruction would otherwise be deemed to be
          received on a day which is not a Business Day or is received after
          2.30 pm, London time (the ‘Cut-Off Time’) on a Business Day, CDAX
          Forex has the right to treat the Client’s Payment Instruction as
          having been received on the next Business Day; and
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) if the Onward Payment is to be made on a specified day or on the
          last day of a specified period and such specified day or last day of a
          specified period shall be on or after whichever is the later in time
          of:
        </p>
        <p>(i) the Maturity Date;</p>
        <p>
          (ii) the Business Day on which Electronic Money is available in the
          relevant currency and/or the Purchase Monies is received as cleared
          funds in the Transaction Account, for the full amount required and
          subject to the Electronic Money and/or funds being available by
          2.30pm; and the Client’s Payment Instruction shall be deemed to be
          received on the day stated for the making of that Onward Payment
        </p>
        <p>
          or, if that is not a Business Day, on the Business Day immediately
          following that date.
        </p>
        <p>19.3 Following receipt of a Payment Instruction, CDAX Forex may:</p>
        <p>
          (a) refuse that Payment Instruction and if it does so, CDAX Forex
          shall (unless it would be unlawful for CDAX Forex to do so) notify the
          Client of that refusal, the reasons for that refusal (if possible),
          and the procedure for rectifying any factual errors that lead to that
          refusal. Such notification shall be given to the Client as soon as
          practicable following the refusal and CDAX Forex may charge the Client
          for such notification where the refusal is reasonably justified. A
          Payment Instruction which is refused by CDAX Forex shall be deemed not
          to have been received for the purposes of Clause 19.2; and/or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) request further confirmation or information from the Client or
          Authorised Person of any Payment Instruction, including if CDAX Forex
          considers that such confirmation or information is desirable or that a
          Payment Instruction is ambiguous; and/or
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) stop the use of all passwords and PINs used by the Client or an
          Authorised Person to access the Online Resources (“Personalised
          Security Credentials”), any foreign currency or Sterling Draft and
          information or other payment procedure or instrument in accordance

        <p>
          (a) a Payment Instruction initiated through a payment initiation
          service provider;

        <p>
          (b) a Payment Instruction initiated in any way, other than through a

          CDAX Forex except:

          (i) if Clause 20.3 applies and the Onward Payment has not been debited
          from CDAX Forex’s accounts before the Client notifies CDAX Forex; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii) if the Client has agreed with CDAX Forex that the Onward Payment
          is to be made on a specific day or on the last day of a certain period
          and the revocation is received by CDAX Forex prior to the Cut-Off Time
          on the Business Day preceding the specified day for the making of the
          Onward Payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any revocation of a Payment Instruction in accordance with this Clause
          19.5 must be received in writing to CDAX Forex by email in accordance
          with Clause 3, such email to include an image of the relevant Payment
          Instruction. Such a revocation is deemed to be a withdrawal of
          consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          19.6 CDAX Forex may charge the Client for any revocation by the Client
          of a Payment Instruction. In particular, but not by way of limitation:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) the Client shall bear all costs, expenses and losses of CDAX Forex
          whatsoever that may arise on account of the revocation; and
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) CDAX Forex may charge interest at the rate referred to in Clause
          24.1 on any sums due to CDAX Forex pursuant to this Clause 19.6.

        <p>
          20.1 The Client must take all reasonable precautions to prevent
          fraudulent or unauthorised use of Payment Services. In particular, it
          is essential that the Client, among other security measures:

          (b) take all reasonable steps to keep safe its Drafts and other
          documentary payment methods it receives;
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) uses the Payment Services provided by CDAX Forex in accordance
          with the terms and conditions for their use as indicated in these
          Terms and on the CDAX Forex website (and in the event of any conflict,
          these Terms shall prevail);
        </p>
        <p>
          (d) notifies CDAX Forex in accordance with Clause 3.1(b) or Clause
          3.1(d) without undue delay on becoming aware of the loss, theft,
          misappropriation or unauthorised use of any Personalised Security
          Credentials or the misappropriation of the Online Resources;
        </p>
        <p>
          (e) notify CDAX Forex in accordance with Clause 3 without undue delay
          on becoming aware of any other unauthorised use of the Payment
          Service;
        </p>
        <p>
          (f) where CDAX Forex communicates with and accepts written
          instructions from the Client’s e-mail address the Client must ensure
          that its e-mail account is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          20.2 CDAX Forex may stop or suspend any Onward Payment (in whole or in
          part) and/or the Client’s use of the Payment Services and the Online
          Resources including all Personalised Security Credentials if it has
          reasonable grounds for doing so relating to:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) the security of the Online Resources, the Payment Service or an
          Onward Payment;
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) the suspected unauthorised or fraudulent use of the Online
          Resources, the Personalised Security Credentials or an Onward Payment;
          and/or
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) where the Onward Payment is being made in connection with a credit
          line, if CDAX Forex believes that there is a significantly increased
          risk that the Client may be unable to fulfil its liability to pay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless doing so would compromise reasonable security measures or be
          unlawful, before stopping or suspending any Onward Payment (in whole
          or in part) or the Client’s use of the Payment Service (as
          appropriate) or immediately after doing so, CDAX Forex must inform the
          Client and give its reasons for doing so. As soon as practicable after
          the reason for stopping or suspending any Onward Payment (in whole or
          in part) or the Client’s use of the Payment Service (as appropriate)
          has ceased to exist, CDAX Forex must allow the outstanding element of
          the Onward Payment or the resumption of the Client’s use of the
          Payment Service (as appropriate).
        </p>
        <p>
          20.3 CDAX Forex may stop or suspend the ability of the Client to use
          an account information service provider or a payment initiation
          service provider if CDAX Forex has reasonably justified and duly
          evidenced reasons for same relating to unauthorised or fraudulent
          access to the Client’s Electronic Money information by that account
          information service provider or payment initiation service provider
          and/or the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent initiation of an Onward
          Payment. If CDAX Forex does deny access to an account information
          service provider or payment initiation service provider in accordance
          with this Clause 20.3, unless doing so would compromise security or is
          unlawful, CDAX Forex shall notify the Client as soon as possible using
          one of the methods set out in Clause 3.4.
        </p>
        <p>20.4 CDAX Forex shall contact the Client either:</p>
        <p>
          (a) via email to the email account it holds on record as belonging to
          the Client; and/or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) via one or both of the Online Resources if the Client has
          registered for same, in the event of suspected or actual fraud or
          security threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          20.5 If the Client believes that a Payment Instruction has been given,
          or an Onward Payment made, in error and/ or was unauthorised by it,
          the Client must notify CDAX Forex as soon as possible via the helpline
          or e-mail address listed in Clause 3. Failure to notify CDAX Forex
          immediately on becoming aware of within the relevant timescale set out
          in clause 21.1 could result in the Client losing its entitlement to
          have the matter corrected
        </p>
        <h3>21. LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY FOR PAYMENT SERVICES</h3>
        <p>
          21.1 Subject to the remainder of this clause 21, where it is
          established that an Onward Payment was not authorised by the Client in
          accordance with Clauses 3 and 19.1 or that an Onward Payment was not
          correctly executed by CDAX Forex and that Client has notified CDAX
          Forex using the contact details set out in Clause 3.1(b) or Cause
          3.1(d) in a timely manner:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) within 13 months of the monies being debited from its accounts, if
          the Client is a consumer, a micro-enterprise or a charity; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) within 6 months of the monies being debited from its accounts, if
          the Client is not a consumer, a micro-enterprise or a charity, CDAX
          Forex shall refund to the Client the full amount debited erroneously
          or without authorisation as soon as practicable and in any event no
          later than the end of the Business Day following the day on which CDAX
          Forex became aware of the unauthorised or incorrectly executed Onward
          Payment, unless CDAX Forex has reasonable grounds to suspect fraud and
          notifies the appropriate authorities.
        </p>
        <p>21.2 The Client will be liable for:</p>
        <p>
          (a) all payments made by CDAX Forex pursuant to a particular
          unauthorised Onward Payment if the Client has acted fraudulently, or
          has intentionally or with gross negligence not complied with its
          obligations under Clause 20.1(a); and
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) subject to Clause 21.3 and where Clause 21.2(a) does not apply, up
          to £35 of any monies paid by CDAX Forex pursuant to a particular
          unauthorised Onward Payment where the Client has otherwise failed to
          comply with its obligations under Clause 20.1(a) except where:
        </p>
        <p>
          (i) the failure to comply with Clause 20.1(a) was not detectable by
          the Client prior to the Onward Payment, except where the Client has
          acted fraudulently; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (ii) the loss was caused by acts or omissions of any employee, agent
          or branch of CDAX Forex or of an entity which carries out activities
          on behalf of CDAX Forex.
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) all unauthorised Onward Payments made by CDAX Forex before it
          notified CDAX Forex in accordance with clause 20.1(d).
        </p>
        <p>
          21.3 Except where the Client has acted fraudulently, the Client shall
          not be liable for unauthorised Onward Payments:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) executed by CDAX Forex after the Client has notified CDAX Forex in
          accordance with Clause 20.1(d), if the corresponding losses are
          directly related to the notification; and
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) where CDAX Forex has failed at any time to provide appropriate
          means for notification.
        </p>
        <p>
          21.4 CDAX Forex shall not be liable for non-execution or defective
          execution in relation to an Onward Payment which it has made in
          accordance with a unique identifier given to it by the Client which
          proves to be incorrect. However, CDAX Forex shall make efforts to
          trace funds involved in that transaction and notify the Client of the
          outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          21.5 CDAX Forex is liable to the Client for the correct execution of a
          Payment Instruction unless:
        </p>
        <p>(a) Clause 21.4 applies; or</p>
        <p>
          (b) CDAX Forex can prove to the Client (and where relevant, to the
          Payee’s payment services provider) that the Payee’s payment services
          provider received the Onward Payment within the appropriate time
          period described in Clause 19.9.
        </p>
        <p>21.6 CDAX Forex shall not be liable to the Client for any:</p>
        <p>
          (a) delay or failure to perform its obligations under these Terms or
          any FX Contract (including any delay in payment) by reason of any
          cause beyond the reasonable control of CDAX Forex including but not
          limited to any action or inaction of the Client or any third party,
          bank delay, postal delay, failure or delay of any fax or electronic
          transmission, any accident, emergency, act of god or any abnormal or
          unforeseeable circumstances; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) consequential or indirect loss (such as loss of profits or
          opportunity) the Client may incur as a result of CDAX Forex failing to
          perform its duties under an FX Contract; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (c) contravention of a requirement imposed on CDAX Forex by
          regulations where that contravention is due to CDAX Forex complying
          with its obligations under the laws of any EEA state or other
          jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          21.7 the Client may be entitled to a refund in certain circumstances
          where an Onward Payment is
        </p>
        <p>
          initiated by the Payee. It is not anticipated that any Onward Payment
          will be initiated by a Payee under any Payment Services provided by
          CDAX Forex and the Client represents and undertakes to that effect in
          Clause 27.1(i). However, details of the circumstances in which a
          refund may apply are available on CDAX Forex’s website.
        </p>
        <p>
          21.8 The provisions in this Clause 21 shall survive termination of
          these Terms or any agreement under these Terms.
        </p>
        <h3>22. OTHER TERMS RELATING TO PAYMENT SERVICES</h3>
        <p>
          22.1 CDAX Forex will send the full amount of the Onward Payment to the
          Payee in accordance with the Payment Instruction. However, CDAX Forex
          cannot guarantee the Payee’s payment service provider or an
          intermediary payment service provider will not deduct a charge for
          receiving any Onward Payment. It is the responsibility of the Client
          to confirm with the Payee’s payment service provider the details of
          any charges. CDAX Forex shall if it is able to, upon request from the
          Client, provide an estimation of any intermediary payment service
          provider charges which may be deducted.
        </p>
        <p>
          22.2 CDAX Forex shall make available to the Client the information
          which the Client is entitled to receive under Regulations. That
          information shall be provided to the Client by email or made available
          via CDAX Forex’s website or (where made available to the Client) via
          the Online Resources. In addition, the Client may at any time request
          from CDAX Forex a copy of:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) the then-current Terms applying between the Client and CDAX Forex
          in relation to Payment Services; and/or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) any information to which the Client is entitled under regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          22.3 The Client may terminate these Terms in relation to Payment
          Services at any time by giving notice to CDAX Forex in accordance with
          Clause 3. Any such termination shall be subject to Clause 25.4.

        <h3>23. SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT FUNDS</h3>
        <p>
          23.1 Where CDAX Forex receives funds for the purpose of issuing
          Electronic Money, the funds corresponding to Electronic Money will be
          held in one or more Segregated Bank Accounts, which are bank accounts
          separate from the bank accounts upon which CDAX Forex’s own funds are
          held in accordance with Isle of Man Financial Services Authority
          Rules.
        </p>
        <p>23.2 Where CDAX Forex:</p>
        <p>
          (a) receives funds directly from the Client for the purpose of using
          those funds; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) redeems the Client’s Electronic Money for the purpose of using the
          corresponding funds to pay any monies owing to CDAX Forex under any FX
          Contract, including any Security Payment or Margin Call, in accordance
          with Clause 12.1, CDAX Forex will hold those monies in an account
          specifically for this purpose (Transaction Account), which is not a
          Segregated Bank Account or CDAX Forex’s bank account where it holds
          its own funds, until the FX Contract is executed.
        </p>
        <h3>24. INTEREST</h3>
        <p>
          24.1 If the Client fails to make any payment required under these
          Terms (including under any FX Contract or Payment Instruction) when it
          falls due, interest will be charged on the outstanding sum at a rate
          specified over the base rate of the Bank of England (or of such
          monetary authority as may replace it). Such interest shall accrue and
          be calculated daily from the date payment was due until the date the
          Client pays in full and shall be compounded monthly.
        </p>
        <p>
          24.2 CDAX Forex may receive and retain or apply for its own benefit
          any interest which arises in respect of any sum held by CDAX Forex in
          its Segregated Bank Accounts and Transaction Accounts.
        </p>
        <h3>25. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h3>
        <p>
          25.1 CDAX Forex may amend these Terms insofar as they relate to
          Foreign Exchange Services by notice in writing or in accordance with
          Clause 3.4 to the Client at any time and such amendments shall take
          effect from the date specified by CDAX Forex but may not affect any
          rights or obligations that have already arisen and will not be
          retrospective.
        </p>
        <p>
          25.2 Subject to Clause 25.3, CDAX Forex may amend these Terms insofar
          as they relate to Payment Services by giving at least 2 months’ notice
          in writing to the Client. If the Client objects to the proposed
          amendments, it has the right, subject to Clause 25.4, to terminate
          these Terms as regards Payment Services without charge before the date
          proposed by CDAX Forex for the entry into force of the changes. The
          Client will be deemed to accept the proposed amendments unless it
          notifies CDAX Forex and terminates these Terms insofar as they relate
          to Payment Services before the date proposed by CDAX Forex for the
          entry into force of the changes. If no objection is received from the
          Client, such
        </p>
        <p>
          amendments shall take effect from the date specified by CDAX Forex but
          may not affect any rights or obligations that have already arisen and
          will not be retrospective.
        </p>
        <p>
          25.3 CDAX Forex does not need to provide any notice to the Client of:
        </p>
        <p>
          (a) any change to these Terms insofar as they relate to Payment
          Services which is more favourable to the Client; or
        </p>
        <p>
          (b) a change to the standard interest rate applying pursuant to Clause
          24.1, which in each case may be applied immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          25.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of these Terms by the
          Client pursuant to Clause 22.3 or Clause 25.2 shall not affect any FX
          Contract nor any rights or obligations that have already arisen at the
          date of the termination. Following any such termination, any onward
          transfer of converted currency to a Payee shall be subject to such
          terms as CDAX Forex and the Client shall agree.
        </p>

          provided by CDAX Forex, the Client may inform CDAX Forex. All
          complaints should in the first instance be made in writing to CDAX

          CDAX Forex will endeavour to review
        </p>
        <p>each complaint carefully and promptly.</p>
        <p>
          26.2 If a complaint relates to the provision by CDAX Forex of Payment
          Services or the issuance or redemption of Electronic Money, if the
          Client is not satisfied with CDAX Forex’s resolution of the complaint,
          the Client may be entitled to refer the matter to the Isle of Man
          Financial Services Ombudsman Scheme (FSOS).
        </p>
        <p>
          The FSOS provides an out-of-court redress mechanism. Please see their

          26.3 If a dispute arises between CDAX Forex and the Client relating to
          the existence or terms of any FX Contract (a ‘Disputed FX Contract’),
          CDAX Forex may close out or take any other action it reasonably
          considers appropriate in relation to the Disputed FX Contract (which
          may include suspension of performance of the Disputed FX Contract)
          pending settlement of the dispute without previously notifying and/or
          without having received instruction from the Client. CDAX Forex will
          try to notify the Client
        </p>
        <p>
          (orally or in writing) what action it has taken, as soon afterwards as
          it practically can, but if it does not, the validity of its action
          shall not be affected.
        </p>

          insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights
          generally and applicable principles of equity);

        <p>
          1.3 Once the Client has been accepted as an Online Seller Client, it

        </p>
        <h3>3. SETTING RULES ON ELECTRONIC MONEY ACCOUNTS</h3>
        <p>
          3.1 The Client is able to set rules (“Rules”) on each of its
          Electronic Money Accounts. When a Rule is set and the condition (the
          “Condition”) in that Rule is satisfied, then an automatic Payment
          Instruction and/ or an automatic FX Order (depending on whether the
          Customer Account and the Destination Account (defined below) are the
          same currency or not) will be placed by the Client with CDAX.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2 There are three Rules which may be set on an Electronic Money
          Account, namely the Immediate AutoWithdraw Rule, the Threshold
          AutoWithdaw Rule and the Exchange Rate AutoWithdraw Rule. Only one
          rule may be set on an Electronic Money Account at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3 If the Immediate AutoWithdraw Rule applies to an Electronic Money
          Account, then the condition which, when satisfied, triggers the
          automatic placing of a Payment Instruction and/or the automatic
          placing of an FX Order, is that any amount of Electronic Money is
          received by the Electronic Money Account (the “Immediate AutoWithdraw
          Condition”).
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4 If the Threshold AutoWithdraw Rule applies to an Electronic Money
          Account, then the condition which, when satisfied, triggers the
          automatic placing of a Payment Instruction and/or an FX Order, is that
          the balance of Electronic Money in the Electronic Money Account
          reaches or exceeds an amount which the Client determined (the
          “Threshold Amount”) when setting the Rule (the “Threshold AutoWithdraw
          Condition”).
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5 If the Exchange Rate AutoWithdraw Rule applies to an Electronic
          Money Account, then the condition which, when satisfied, triggers the
          automatic placing of a Payment Instruction and/or the automatic
          placing of an FX Order, is that the exchange rate which the Client can
          obtain from CDAX to use the Electronic Money to purchase the currency
          the client chooses when setting the Rule, is the same as or more
          beneficial to the Client than the exchange rate which the Client
          determined (the “Threshold Exchange Rate”) when setting the Rule (the
          “Exchange Rate AutoWithdraw Rule”).
        </p>
        <p>
          3.6 The following information is required in order to set a Rule: (a)
          the details of the Electronic Money Account the Rule is to apply to;
          (b) the details of the bank account which the monies, subject to the
          Payment Instruction, are to be sent to (the “Destination Account”) and
          the currency of same; (c) whether the Immediate AutoWithdraw Rule or
          the Threshold AutoWithdraw Rule or the Exchange Rate AutoWithdraw Rule
          is to apply to the Electronic Money Account; (d) if the Threshold
          AutoWithdraw Rule is to apply to the Electronic Money Account, the
          relevant Threshold Amount; (e) if the Exchange Rate AutoWithdraw Rule
          is to apply to the Electronic Money Account, the relevant Threshold
          Exchange Rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.7 The Client is able to set, amend, pause or delete the Rules
          applying to each of its Electronic Money Accounts either via telephone
          using the contact details set out in Clause 3 or via the Client’s
          secure area of the Online Seller Site. For the avoidance of doubt, the
          Client setting and pausing or cancelling a Rule on an Electronic Money
          Account is the Client consenting and withdrawing consent to the
          execution of the payment instruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.8 The Client will receive notifications from CDAX when it sets,
          amends or cancels a Rule or when the condition of a Rule set on an
          Electronic Money Account has been satisfied. If the Client receives a
          notification which it, or an authorised user did not action or which
          it otherwise should not have received, then the Client must inform
          CDAX as soon as it becomes aware by using the contact details set out
          in Clause 3. 4.
        </p>
        <h3>4. TERMS OF AN FX ORDER AUTOMATICALLY PLACED</h3>
        <p>
          4.1 If: (a) the conditions of a Rule applying to an Electronic Money
          Account are satisfied; and (b) in that Rule the currency of the
          Electronic Money Account is different to the currency of the
          Destination Account, (c) (then an FX Order will automatically be
          placed by the Client with CDAX.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 The terms of an FX Order, which is automatically placed with CDAX,
          will be as follows: (a) the foreign exchange contract is to be a spot
          contract redeeming all of the Electronic Money in the relevant
          Electronic Money Account and using the equivalent amount of money in
          the same currency as the Electronic Money to purchase money in the
          currency of the Destination Account; (b) the exchange rate is the sum
          of: (i) the margin agreed between CDAX and the Client for the purchase
          of the currency of the Destination Account using the currency of the
          Electronic Money Account; and (ii) the exchange rate which CDAX
          believes, acting reasonably, that it would be able obtain if it were
          to purchase the currency of the Destination Account using the currency
          of the Electronic Money Account on the wholesale markets at the time
          the FX Order is accepted by CDAX.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 The Client acknowledges that, even if the Exchange Rate
          AutoWithdraw Rule applies, the exchange rate applied will still be as
          set out in paragraph 4.2(b). Accordingly, in rare cases, the exchange
          rate which
        </p>
        <p>
          applies to the Client’s FX Contract might be less beneficial to the
          Client than the Threshold Exchange Rate.
        </p>
        <h3>5. TERMS OF A PAYMENT INSTRUCTION AUTOMATICALLY PLACED</h3>
        <p>
          5.1 The terms of a Payment Instruction, which is automatically placed
          with CDAX, will be as follows: (a) the monies to be sent are: (i) (all
          of the money which is available to the Client (less any charges) as a
          result of the Electronic Money in the Electronic Money Account being
          redeemed in the event that no FX Order has automatically been placed
          with CDAX; (ii) the money which is purchased using the money which is
          available to the Client (less any charges) as a result of the
          Electronic Money in the Electronic Money Account being redeemed in the
          event that an FX Order was automatically placed at the same time the
          Payment Instruction was automatically placed. (b) the details of the
          Payee will be the details of the Destination Account supplied when
          creating or amending the relevant Rule.
        </p>
        <h3>6. ACCESS TO CLIENT’S SECURE AREA OF THE ONLINE SELLER SITE</h3>
        <p>
          6.1 The Client’s secure area of the Online Seller Site (the “Online
          Seller Site”) is accessed by entering the Client’s username and
          password on the appropriate page of CDAX’s website.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2 The Client’s secure area of the Online Seller Site allows the
          Client to view the amount of money held in each Electronic Money

        </p>
        <p>
